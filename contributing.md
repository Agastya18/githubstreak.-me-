## Setting up Environment Variables

1. Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into the new `.env` file.
3. Replace the placeholder values with your own credentials and configuration settings.

Note: The `.env` file should never be committed to version control, as it contains sensitive information.
